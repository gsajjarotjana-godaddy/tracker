This will give you a URL you can access from anywhere, including your iPhone!

STEP 1: CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY
---------------------------------
1. Go to github.com and sign in (or create account)
2. Click the "+" icon in top right
3. Click "New repository"
4. Name it: "habit-tracker" (or any name you want)
5. Make it PUBLIC (required for free GitHub Pages)
6. DO NOT check "Initialize with README" (we already have files)
7. Click "Create repository"


STEP 2: PUSH YOUR CODE TO GITHUB
---------------------------------
Open Terminal and run these commands:

cd "/Users/grace/Desktop/development/habit tracker"

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/habit-tracker.git
(Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main

(You'll be asked to enter your GitHub username and password/token)


STEP 3: ENABLE GITHUB PAGES
----------------------------
1. On GitHub, go to your repository page
2. Click "Settings" (top menu)
3. Scroll down to "Pages" (left sidebar)
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select branch: "main"
6. Select folder: "/ (root)"
7. Click "Save"
8. Wait 1-2 minutes for it to deploy


STEP 4: ACCESS ON YOUR IPHONE
------------------------------
1. Your app will be available at:
   https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/habit-tracker/
   
   (Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)

2. On your iPhone:
   - Open Safari
   - Go to that URL
   - It will open the tracker! ✅

3. Add to Home Screen:
   - Tap Share button
   - Tap "Add to Home Screen"
   - Now it's like an app!


TROUBLESHOOTING:

- Make sure index.html is in the root of the repo
