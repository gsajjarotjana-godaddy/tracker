🎯 SIMPLEST SOLUTION - FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS:
================================================

METHOD 1: iCLOUD DRIVE (RECOMMENDED - 100% WORKS!)
---------------------------------------------------

1. On your Mac:
   - Open Finder
   - Press Cmd+Shift+I (opens iCloud Drive)
   - Drag "index.html" into iCloud Drive
   - Wait for sync (cloud icon appears)

2. On your iPhone:
   - Open Safari (NOT Files app!)

METHOD 2: IF SERVER DIDN'T WORK - CHECK THESE:
-----------------------------------------------

What error did you see?
- "Can't connect" → Check WiFi (both devices same network?)
- "Page not found" → Try: http://192.168.1.67:8000/index.html
- Nothing happens → Check Terminal - is server running?
- Blank page → Try refreshing

Quick server test:
1. On your Mac, open Safari
2. Go to: http://localhost:8000
3. If this works, server is fine - problem is network/iPhone
4. If this doesn't work, server isn't running properly


METHOD 3: USE DROPBOX OR GOOGLE DRIVE
--------------------------------------
1. Upload index.html to Dropbox/Google Drive
2. Get shareable link
3. Open link in Safari on iPhone
4. Download and open


RECOMMENDED: Use Method 1 (iCloud Drive) - it's the most reliable!
