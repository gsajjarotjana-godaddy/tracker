TROUBLESHOOTING - IF IT DIDN'T WORK
====================================

CHECK THESE THINGS:
-------------------

1. Are both devices on the SAME WiFi network?
   - Mac: System Settings → Network → check WiFi name
   - iPhone: Settings → WiFi → check WiFi name
   - They MUST match!

2. Is the server running?
   - Check Terminal - you should see "Serving HTTP on..."
   - If not, double-click "start-server.sh"

3. Try these URLs on your iPhone Safari:
   - http://192.168.1.67:8000
   - http://192.168.1.67:8000/index.html
   - Try with "https" removed if you added it

4. Check Mac Firewall:
   - System Settings → Network → Firewall
   - Make sure it's not blocking connections

5. Try accessing from Mac first:
   - Open Safari on your Mac
   - Go to: http://localhost:8000
   - If this works, the server is fine
