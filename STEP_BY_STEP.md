# Step-by-Step GitHub Setup

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: https://github.com/new
3. Repository name: `habit-tracker` (or any name you like)
4. Description (optional): "Habit and Money Tracker App"
5. Make sure it's set to **PUBLIC** (required for free GitHub Pages)
6. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
7. **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore" (we already have one)
8. Click the green **"Create repository"** button

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. 
Look for a URL that looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/habit-tracker.git
```

Copy that URL - we'll need it in the next step!

## Step 3: Come Back Here

Once you've created the repo and have the URL, let me know and I'll help you push the code!
